# Feature ideas

- **Save/bookmark jobs** — persist saved jobs to `localStorage`, toggle a "Saved" filter
- **Unified search** — single search box across title and company (current title filter is title-only)
- **Job type filter** — full-time/part-time/contract filter chip (requires n8n to extract from listings)
- **Shareable filtered URLs** — encode active filters in URL (`?title=reporter&location=Remote`); `?company=` already works, expand to all filters
